This is the model for Outset Island in Wind Waker. Interiors and other seperate models not included.
This model was ripped by Lexou, credit is not needed, but it's always nice.
The vertex coloring caused the sea to be gray when exported, so, if you want it to be normal, just color the Sea.SS## texture files.
Anyways, enjoy !
